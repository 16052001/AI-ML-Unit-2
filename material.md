# Course Material & Lectures <a name="material"></a>

## ðŸ“– Course Material 

It is in the form of Jupyter Notebook slides with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LaTeX"> math, code, drawings, plots and explanations

- Slides and material will be uploaded before every lecture on Google Classroom and here.
 - Good starting point but **but may be not enough**.
 - [Textbooks](textbooks) are required.
