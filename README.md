Course Material for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning - Unit 2 AA 2021/2022 @ Computer Science Dept, Sapienza

## Course Description

Taught in English üá∫üá∏

II year, II semester, ACSAI degree (bachelor)

**Description:** The course is meant to introduce machine learning, a class of methods that learn patterns from data and perform predictions on new data. This Unit complements the Unit I course on AI and formal logic. In terms of structure and philosophy, I would balance the amount of theoretical content *(knowing what you are doing)* with practical sessions *(knowing how to do it)*. Note this is an introductory course to Machine Learning (ML) and is not an entire course on ‚ÄúDeep Learning‚Äù (DL), although some basic DL concepts are introduced and covered. The course emphasizes the theory part, whereas this latter is always accompanied by practical applications on some toy data to let the students understand in practice what happens (this means sometimes implementing the underlying basic algorithm from scratch). When possible, the course will make a few connections to recent research papers in AI&ML e show some interesting AI applications.
